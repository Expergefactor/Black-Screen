# Black-Screen
Built to help me focus, this is a very minimal HTML file with a simple JS script to simply back out a screen with a double click. That is all that it does!

# Instructions 
Just download the 'blackscreen.html' file and open it to use. Simple!

* Double click to black out the screen. 
* Double click to revert to normal browser.
